### Overview

The _radio protocol_ refers to the suite of protocols used to move data from the host computer to a robot or vice versa. This includes other protocols than simply those that actually travel by radio \(for instance, the USB protocol between the host computer and the radio dongle\). For convenience, all these parts fall under the general umbrella “radio protocol”.

### Hardware Information

We are currently using the MRF24J40MD-I/RM chipset for our radio system. It is compliant with the IEEE 802.15.4 standard, and we have developed a custom radio protocol for our communication packets. The chipset operates at the 2.4 GHz frequency band. The bandwidth of each transceiver channel is 3 MHz. The channels available with this chipset are channels 11 - 26 \(0x0B to 0x1A\). The center frequency of each channel is 5 MHz away from adjacent channels. By default, we use 4 channels, channels 23-26. These correspond to channels 0 to 3 on the robot's dip-switches.

### The Universe

The model of the universe within the radio protocol is to provide communication between exactly one host computer and between zero and eight robots, identified by numerical indices from 0 to 7. Other models \(such as the use of multiple host computers\) can be achieved by creating multiple universes, but those universes do not interact with each other and are thus uninteresting. For example, running two fleets of robots by radio from two separate hosts using distinct radio channels would constitute two universes.

Within a universe, data travels from the host computer to a robot or from a robot to the host. Data does not travel directly from one robot to another. Within these documents, the term out refers to data travelling from host to robot, while the term in refers to data travelling from robot to host. The host can communicate with up to sixteen robots by time-sharing the spectrum among them.

### The Transports

Communication occurs over two distinct transport layers. The USB Protocol? carries data over a USB cable between the host computer and the radio dongle, and the 802.15.4 Protocol? carries data over the air between the radio dongle and the robots.

### The Application-Layer Encoding

At the application layer, there are three fundamental types of communication that occur: the camera packet, which is flooded from the host to the robots, and inbound and outbound messages, which are one-time transmissions. This section defines the formats of those structures.

**The Camera Packet**

The camera packet is a variable sized packet. It is comprised of the following: One byte containing the mask vector that indicates whether valid data exists for each robot. One byte of flag data. Zero or four bytes of ball position data, if there is valid ball vision data. Zero to eight subpackets of 6 bytes each, one per robot that has valid vision data, in ascending order of robot number. Eight bytes of packet timestamp, the timestamp from the vision data. One byte of status data.

The camera packet will be sent with a minimum frequency of 10 Hz, even if there is no camera data. If 100 ms has passed without valid camera data being sent to the robots, then the dongle will send an empty camera packet. This allows for emergency stop data to be sent to the robot in a timely fashion.

The one byte mask vector will contain a '1' in each index if there is valid vision data for the robot at the corresponding index. Index zero corresponds to robot 0, index 7 corresponds to robot 7, for a maximum of 8 robots at a time.

The flag byte conveys miscellaneous information about the nature of the camera packet. Note that if an emergency stop packet is being sent, there is no camera timestamp. The robots will obey movement primitive commands when the emergency stop flag is zero, and will ignore primitives and stop moving when the emergency stop bit is one. The flag byte will contain the following flag bits:

| Bit | Flag |
| :--- | :--- |
| 7-3 | Reserved |
| 2 | Does packet contain a ball position? |
| 1 | Does packet contain a camera timestamp? |
| 0 | Emergency Stop flag |

If the ball position flag is high in the flag byte, the following 2 words will contain the ball x-position and the ball y-position:

| Word | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| 0 | Ball's global x-position, in mm |
| 1 | Ball's global y-position, in mm |

The next bytes will contain the robot subpackets, the number of which will depend on which bits are set in the mask vector. Each robot subpacket contains three two-byte words. A robot subpacket will only be transmitted if there is valid vision data for that robot. The four two-byte words \(stored in little-endian order\) are stored in the following order:

| Word | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| 0 | Robot's global x-position, in mm |
| 1 | Robot's global y-position, in mm |
| 2 | Robot's signed global angle position, in milliradians |

The next eight bytes are the vision data timestamp, and will contain the little-endian encoding of a count of milliseconds since 00:00:00 1970-01-01 UTC.

The final byte in the camera packet is the status byte. This byte indicates which robot number should send a status update to avoid collisions. The decoding is as shown below:

| Bits | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| 7-3 | Reserved |
| 2-0 | Robot number |

### The Drive Packet

The drive packet is a 81-byte packet, comprising eight subpackets of nine bytes each, one per robot; one byte of emergency stop data; and eight bytes of packet timestamp.

Each robot subpacket comprises a one-byte header and four two-byte words. The header bits are allocated as follows:

| Bit | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| 7 | 1 if the robot should send a status update at this time, or 0 if not |
| 6–4 | Reserved |
| 3–0 | Serial number, incremented when a new movement primitive is started |

The four two-byte words \(stored in little-endian order\) are each decoded as follows, to yield some high bits and one of the four movement primitive parameter values:

| Bit\(s\) | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| 15–12 | High bits, decoded as described below |
| 11 | Exponent, if 1 then multiply parameter value by 10 |
| 10 | Sign, if 1 then negate parameter value |
| 9–0 | Magnitude of parameter value as an unsigned integer |

The high bits are interpreted as follows:

| Word | Bit\(s\) | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 0 | 15–12 | Movement primitive number |
| 1 | 15 | Enable capacitor charger |
| 1 | 14 | Enable capacitor safe discharge |
| 1 | 13–12 | Scalar speed for final primitive velocity |
| 2 | 15–12 | Movement primitive extra data, bits 3–0 |
| 3 | 15 | Movement primitive slow flag |
| 3 | 14–12 | Movement primitive extra data, bits 6–4 |

The emergency stop byte is 0 for normal operation with the robots obeying their movement primitives, or 1 for emergency stop where movement primitive are ignored and robots stop moving.

The timestamp is the little-endian encoding of a count of milliseconds since 00:00:00 1970-01-01 UTC. It is updated on every packet sent, even if there is no new data in the packet.

### The Outbound Message Packets

Each message packet begins with a byte indicating the purpose of the message followed by zero or more bytes of parameters specific to the purpose. The possible messages are as follows:

| Byte value | Purpose | Payload |  |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |

### The Outbound Message Packets

Each movement primitive is assigned to a specific purpose byte, with a variable number of data bytes depending on the input parameters to the primitive. Each primitive is assigned a maximum of 5 two-byte signed little-endian words corresponding to a maximum of 4 input parameters and an additional flag word. The possible messages are as follows:

Each extension begins with a byte identifying the type of the extension, followed by an extension-specific number of bytes whose purpose is specific to the extension.

_**Error Bits \(Extension 0\)**_

The payload contains a bitmask of the level-triggered, followed by the edge-triggered, errors currently being reported. For a level-triggered error, the error bit continues to show as 1 until the error is cleared, but latching ensures that the error appears as 1 for at least one packet even if the error is momentary. For an edge-triggered error, the error bit appears as 1 on the first packet following any occurrence of the error. See firmware/main/error.h for the list of possible errors of each type.

_**Build IDs \(Extension 1\)**_

The payload contains the build IDs of the microcontroller firmware and the FPGA bitstream, each a 32-bit little-endian integer. This extension is included in one feedback packet when requested by means of the Request Build IDs outbound packet.

_**LPS Data \(Extension 2\)**_

The payload contains the four reflectance values, scaled by 10×, each an 8-bit integer.

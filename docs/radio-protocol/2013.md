### Overview

The radio protocol refers to the suite of protocols used to move data from the host computer to a robot or vice versa. This includes other protocols than simply those that actually travel by radio \(for instance, the USB protocol between the host computer and the radio dongle\). For convenience, all these parts fall under the general umbrella “radio protocol”.

### The Universe

The model of the universe within the radio protocol is to provide communication between exactly one host computer and between zero and eight robots, identified by numerical indices from 0 to 7. Other models \(such as the use of multiple host computers\) can be achieved by creating multiple universes, but those universes do not interact with each other and are thus uninteresting. For example, running two fleets of robots by radio from two separate hosts using distinct radio channels would constitute two universes.

Within a universe, data travels from the host computer to a robot or from a robot to the host. Data does not travel directly from one robot to another. Within these documents, the term out refers to data travelling from host to robot, while the term in refers to data travelling from robot to host. The host can communicate with up to sixteen robots by time-sharing the spectrum among them.

### The Transports

Communication occurs over two distinct transport layers. The USB Protocol carries data over a USB cable between the host computer and the radio dongle, and the 802.15.4 Protocol? carries data over the air between the radio dongle and the robots.

### The Application-Layer Encoding

At the application layer, there are three fundamental types of communication that occur: the drive packet, which is flooded from the host to the robots, and inbound and outbound messages, which are one-time transmissions. This section defines the formats of those structures.

### The Drive Packet

The drive packet is a 81-byte packet, comprising eight subpackets of nine bytes each, one per robot; one byte of emergency stop data; and eight bytes of packet timestamp.

Each robot subpacket comprises a one-byte header and four two-byte words. The header bits are allocated as follows:

| Bit | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| 7 | 1 if the robot should send a status update at this time, or 0 if not |
| 6–4 | Reserved |
| 3–0 | Serial number, incremented when a new movement primitive is started |

The four two-byte words \(stored in little-endian order\) are each decoded as follows, to yield some high bits and one of the four movement primitive parameter values:

| Bit\(s\) | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| 15–12 | High bits, decoded as described below |
| 11 | Exponent, if 1 then multiply parameter value by 10 |
| 10 | Sign, if 1 then negate parameter value |
| 9–0 | Magnitude of parameter value as an unsigned integer |

The high bits are interpreted as follows:

| Word | Bit\(s\) | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 0 | 15–12 | Movement primitive number |
| 1 | 15 | Enable capacitor charger |
| 1 | 14 | Enable capacitor safe discharge |
| 1 | 13–12 | Reserved |
| 2 | 15–12 | Movement primitive extra data, bits 3–0 |
| 3 | 15 | Movement primitive slow flag |
| 3 | 14–12 | Movement primitive extra data, bits 6–4 |

The emergency stop byte is 0 for normal operation with the robots obeying their movement primitives, or 1 for emergency stop where movement primitive are ignored and robots stop moving.

The timestamp is the little-endian encoding of a count of milliseconds since 00:00:00 1970-01-01 UTC. It is updated on every packet sent, even if there is no new data in the packet.

### The Outbound Message Packets

Each message packet begins with a byte indicating the purpose of the message followed by zero or more bytes of parameters specific to the purpose. The possible messages are as follows:

| Byte value | Purpose | Payload |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 0x00 | Fire kicker immediately | 3 bytes: 0: 0x00 = fire kicker, 0x01 = fire chipper, 0x02–0xFF = reserved **OR** 1–2: pulse width in microseconds, 16 bits, little endian |
| 0x01 | Arm autokick | 3 bytes: 0: 0x00 = fire kicker, 0x01 = fire chipper, 0x02–0xFF = reserved **OR** 1–2: pulse width in kick microseconds, 16 bits, little endian |
| 0x02 | Disarm autokick | 0 bytes |
| 0x03 | Set LED mode | 1 byte: 0–4: output Hall sensors from motor _n_ or 5–8: output optical encoder signals from encoder _n_−5 **OR** 0x20: normal run condition \(shows break beam and autokick arm\) **OR** 0x21: lamp test **OR** 0x22–0xFF: reserved |
| 0x04–0x07 | Reserved to avoid collisions with old protocols | N/A |
| 0x08 | Reboot | 0 bytes |
| 0x09 | Force on motor power | 0 bytes |
| 0x0A | Reserved for legacy reasons | 0 bytes |
| 0x0B | Set bootup radio parameters \(Obsolete\) | 4 bytes: 0: channel number **OR** 1: robot index **OR** 2–3: PAN ID, 16 bits, little endian |
| 0x0C | Shut down | 0 bytes |
| 0x0D | Request Build IDs | 0 bytes |
| 0x0E–0xFF | Reserved for future use | N/A |

| 8 | Flags and logger status, bitfield: `[0–5]` logger status **OR** `[6]` 1 = capacitor charged, 0 = capacitor not charged **OR** `[7]` 1 = ball in beam, 0 = ball not in beam |

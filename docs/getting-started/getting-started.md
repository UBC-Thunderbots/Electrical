# Getting Started

Information for new members of the Electrical sub-team on how to navigate the electrical system, and setup CAD software and their firmware development environment.

## CAD Software

To view or create any schematics and PCBs, you must first install CAD software for schematic capture and PCB layout. Follow the instructions in the [CAD software tutorial](docs/getting-started/cad-software.md) to get set up.

## Electronics

To become acquainted with the electrical system, read through the [board overview document](docs/getting-started/board-overview.md). The document provides a detailed overview of all the PCBs and their functionality.

## LED Patterns

To learn about the purposes of our different LED colours and patterns, read the [LED patterns document](docs/getting-started/led-patterns.md).

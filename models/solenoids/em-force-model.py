# Purpose: Calculating the magnetic field strength at a point P, a certain distance away from the centre,
# along the axis to the direction the force is being exerted.
#
# Ampereâ€™s law allows us to find the strength of a magnetic field (MF) within a solenoid, where the field is uniform.
# However, this does not apply outside the solenoid (at its edges).
# To find the MF strength at a point P outside the body of the solenoid, we use the following program.
#
# P is perpendicular to the cross section of the solenoid.
# This value is then used as an input to determine the electromagnetic force.

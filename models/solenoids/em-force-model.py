# Purpose: Calculating the magnetic field strength at a point P, a certain distance away from the centre,
# along the axis to the direction the force is being exerted.
#
# Ampereâ€™s law allows us to find the strength of a magnetic field (MF) within a solenoid, where the field is uniform.
# However, this does not apply outside the solenoid (at its edges).
# To find the MF strength at a point P outside the body of the solenoid, we use the following program.
#
# P is perpendicular to the cross section of the solenoid.
# This value is then used as an input to determine the electromagnetic force.

# Constants

# Values determined by design, these being the parameters we can change by changing the design of the solenoid

distPToCenter = 18  # distance from point P to center
numCoils = 100  # number of coils
crossSectionAreaSolenoid = pow((innerDiameter / 2 + shellCasingThickness), 2) * math.pi
# area calculation (cross section of solenoid)

# External Values, changeable, but dependent on other components
